A simple game of Asteroids in javascript using the p5.js library for graphics and sound.

#### Todo

**performance**
- [ ] recycle objects (specifically asteroids) instead of allocating & GC
- [ ] update off-screen items less frequently but at a higher time step

**gameplay/graphics**
- [x] "star field" background instead of grid

**other**
- [ ] multiplayer online??
